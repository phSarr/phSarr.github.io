Quasar RAT is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that stands out for its [open-source](https://github.com/quasar/Quasar) nature. It supports a wide range of functionalities like keylogging, file transfer, victim screen/webcam monitoring, command execution via CMD and many more. Here it's being distributed utilizing a tampered version of [foobar2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar2000) which is an audio player.

You can check the report and download the sample [here](https://app.any.run/tasks/0b4feff1-abab-4f51-9977-3f7ee80309f6/)

## ANYRUN Analysis

The sample is pretty straightforward, the first stage is just a dropper for the payload identified as Quasar RAT.

And that should be the log file location containing the user keystrokes :

The traffic to Location/IP lookup can also be noticed here:

## Dropper Analysis

| Property | Value |
| ------ | ----------- |
| File Type | 32-bit C++ Executable |
| SHA-256 | 4a72f3948f014c2ded502832814c6d65feb78bd1caef7df8bcecb78f7a90b6e2 |

On comparing both the tampered `foobar2000` and the original binary we notice extra `BMP` files which look like the encrypted payload that will be dropped into the system

A quick BinDiff between the tampered binary and the original executable we notice that it's using C++ Runtime Library Code Tampering executing shellcode at the end of the `___security_init_cookie` that eventually decrypts the payload and runs it in a new process

| File Type | 32-bit .NET Executable |
| SHA-256 | D440B5F2E9A6B34CFEC79361172FA287816BCD02D1313B5FFCCE93892B3DB27F |

The settings initialization function decrypts the configuration. It uses AES mixed with `PBKDF2` key.

![key and iv](assets/img/posts/2024-06-10-C_Runtime_Library_Code_Tampering_Loads_QuasarRAT/keyiv.png)

![aes](assets/img/posts/2024-06-10-C_Runtime_Library_Code_Tampering_Loads_QuasarRAT/aes.png)

We can use a [config extractor](https://github.com/nccgroup/Cyber-Defence/blob/master/Scripts/quasar/quasar_decrypter.py) but ANY.RUN provides the configuration for us in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Version": "1.3.0.0",
  "C2": [
    "roblox.airdns.org:62604",
    ""
  ],
  "Sub_Dir": "SubDir",
  "Install_Name": "Runtime Broker.exe",
  "Mutex": "QSR_MUTEX_DT5aFgoH5h6bbtKq7Q",
  "Startup": "Runtime Broker",
  "Tag": "new",
  "LogDir": "Logs",
  "Signature": "",
  "Certificate": ""
}
```

The other initialization takes care of the RAT functionalities like its location (currently set to be in `%AppData%/SubDir/RuntimeBroker.exe`), persistence, mutex and C2 communication.

![init](assets/img/posts/2024-06-10-C_Runtime_Library_Code_Tampering_Loads_QuasarRAT/init.png)

### Persistence

It sets up persistence by adding a value to the registry key `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run` and if the user is admin it sets up a scheduled task to run every time on user logon

![persist](assets/img/posts/2024-06-10-C_Runtime_Library_Code_Tampering_Loads_QuasarRAT/persist.png)

It also hides the installation directory and the logs folder.

### Victim GeoInfo

It tries to get the location and public IP of the victim by connecting to `http://ip-api.com` or `http://api.ipify.org`, or this one:

![GeoLocation and IP](assets/img/posts/2024-06-10-C_Runtime_Library_Code_Tampering_Loads_QuasarRAT/geoip.png)

### Keylogger

Mouse and Keyboard logging functionality:

![logger](assets/img/posts/2024-06-10-C_Runtime_Library_Code_Tampering_Loads_QuasarRAT/keylog.png)

### Commands

Quasar RAT supports a wide range of functionalities available on their GitHub so I will just go over some highlights

#### Commands Execution

It allows executing commands via CMD

![exec](assets/img/posts/2024-06-10-C_Runtime_Library_Code_Tampering_Loads_QuasarRAT/exec.png)

![create session](assets/img/posts/2024-06-10-C_Runtime_Library_Code_Tampering_Loads_QuasarRAT/cmd.png)
