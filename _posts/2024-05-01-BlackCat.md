# Overview

`BlackCat` (also known as `Noberus` or `ALPHV`) is a sophisticated ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) that has been used in operations since November 2021. It is believed to be a successor to the `REvil`, `Darkside`, and `BlackMatter` ransomware gangs, and it has connections to the `FIN7` and `FIN12` cybercrime groups.

BlackCat is notable for its technical sophistication. It is written in the Rust programming language. BlackCat is also highly customizable, allowing affiliates to tailor it to their specific needs.

Like all ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations, the BlackCat operators recruit affiliates to perform corporate breaches and encrypt devices while retaining code maintenance and development
responsibilities for themselves. The executable includes a JSON configuration that allows that customization. This includes extensions, ransom note details, encryption, services targeted for termination and whitelisted folders/files/extensions.

## Sample Analysis

| Property | Value |
| ------ | ----------- |
| File Type   | 32-bit executable |
| SHA-256 | ECEA6B772742758A2240898EF772CA11AA9D870AEC711CFFAB8994C23044117C |

The sample provided works as a command-line tool with a couple of options

![black_cat](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/help.png)

 So for this to run, it requires an access token to be provided, as mentioned earlier Since it's a `RaaS` I believe such token is to identify affiliates by the BlackCat authors as they let other attackers use their ransomware, conduct their own campaigns, and keep a percentage of what they earn. Most RaaS operations allow affiliates to keep 70% of their profits. With BlackCat, however, affiliates can expect to keep 80-90%.

 Additionally requiring such token to run would work as an anti-sandbox technique for most sandboxes.

Here's how it runs with verbose option :

![black_cat verbose](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/cmd_log.png)

 We can also find the configuration in JSON format:

![black_cat](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/config.png)

It contains the public RSA key, the extension to be used after encryption, ransom note text, services/processes to kill to disable recovery/not to be interrupted/noticed while it runs, file extensions/directories/files to avoid, and network propagation capability etc...

BlackCat has 3 TLS callbacks that work as initialization, in addition to setting up Structured Exceptions using `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter`

It utilizes named pipes to operate and encrypt system files, It creates 2 pipes with `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY` and `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN` attributes, and each pipe is named by adding the BlackCat `PID` into a randomly generated number concatenated to the string `\\\\.\\pipe\\__rust_anonymous_pipe1__`. example:

![named pipe](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/namedpipe2.png )

![PID](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/pid.png)

It also queries if it has the following privileges and tries to grant it to itself :

```text
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege, SeSystemProfilePrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, SeSystemtimePrivileg, SeRestorePrivilege, SeShutdownPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege, SeChangeNotifyPrivilege, SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege, SeUndockPrivilege, SeManageVolumePrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeCreateGlobalPrivilege, SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege, SeTimeZonePrivilege, SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege, SeDelegateSessionUserImpersonatePrivilege
```

![tokens](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/priv.png)

If BlackCat isn't running with admin privileges, It attempts to bypass UAC using `CMSTPLUA` COM interface. Here's a POC [here](https://gist.github.com/hfiref0x/196af729106b780db1c73428b5a5d68d#file-akagi_41-c) and [here](https://github.com/0xlane/BypassUAC/blob/master/BypassUAC_Dll/dllmain.cpp).
It uses `CoGetObject`, `CoInitializeEx` and the `CLSID` `{3E5FC7F9-9A51-4367-9063-A120244FBEC7}`.

![clsid ref](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/clsid.png)

It also checks if the user is a domain admin and gets the username/PCname.

BlackCat spawns CMD processes to do the following using the previously created pipes:

* Getting `UUID` which I believe is used (with Username and PCname) to generate an access token for the victim on the affiliates' site.

  ![UUID](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/getuuid.png)

* Allowing remote-to-local and remote-to-remote symbolic links for `file_work.rs` file which could contain code that is used by ransomware to encrypt files and it is also often used by ransomware to spread to other drives/machines on the infected network.
  
  `fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2R:1`

  ![symlink](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/symlink.png)

* Stopping the Internet Information Services (IIS) service.

  `iisreset.exe /stop`

* Modifying the registry to change the MaxMpxCt setting. The MaxMpxCt setting controls the maximum number of outstanding SMB requests that a server can handle. By increasing the MaxMpxCt setting to 65535, the server can handle more concurrent SMB requests therefore helping in the process of reading/writing or encrypting files.

  `reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters /v MaxMpxCt /d 65535 /t REG_DWORD /f`

* Deleting shadow copies that work as a backup.

  `vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /all /quiet\`

  `wmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete\`
  
* Gather information about the network.

  `arp -a`

* It tries to use BCDedit to set the value of a boot configuration data (BCD) entry but the command doesn't seem to be correct or complete. Perhaps it was intended for something else but wasn't completely implemented.

  `bcdedit /set {default}`

* Disables the recovery environment for the default boot entry in the Windows boot configuration data (BCD).

  `bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No`

* Clears all event logs on the machine.

  `cmd.exe /c for /F \\\"tokens=*\\\" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl \\\"%1\\\"\"`

BlackCat priorities encryption for `\Device\HarddiskVolume2\Recovery\WindowsRE\boot.sdi`, `Winre.wim` which is a Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) image file and `ReAgent.xml` this is to prevent the victim from accessing Windows RE and the recovery tools. This makes it more difficult for the victim to recover their files without paying the ransom.

[comment]: <> (it can mount hidden drivers or mounts one of its own as a buffer for files encryption or it mounts the backup volume to encrypt it?)

I do believe it also mounts the hidden recovery partition to encrypt that as well. A recovery partition is a special partition on the system hard drive and is used to restore the system to factory settings in the event of system issues.

It also tries to traverse volumes trying to resolve volume symbolic links in an attempt to self-propagate to other network machines. It also utilizes PsExec to execute a command on a remote computer and then detach from the remote session.

![psexec](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/psexec.png)

Here it creates the ransom note on the desktop :

![ransom note](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/recover_txt.png)

![ransom note](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/note.png)

It also creates the short ransom note image that will be set as a desktop background.

![ransom note](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/ransom_png.png)

![ransom note](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/ransom_note.png)

The ransom note is also added in all system folders along with checkpoint files that will later be deleted.

BlackCat spawns multiple threads for file encryption.

BlackCat uses `AES` encryption with a randomly generated key using `BCryptGenRandom`.

The way this works is:

* It iterates over system files using `FindFirstFileW` and `FindNextFileW`.
* generates the random AES key and builds up a JSON block containing information about chunk size, algorithm used (AES) and key used.
* Such JSON formatted block is encrypted using the public key provided in the configuration.
* After that, the encrypted block is written at the end of the file in addition to changing the file extension to `kh1ftzx`.
* Later on, it reiterates these files encrypting their content and writing it.
  
The affiliates should have the private key required to decrypt the JSON block and therefore the AES key to decrypt file contents, so unfortunately I don't think I'm able to write a decryptor at the moment.

![json block](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/json_block.png)

Here the JSON block is being written in the process heap.

![json key](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/json_key.png)

The beginning and end of the encrypted JSON block are bounded with the bytes `19 47 B3 01`.

![writing to file](assets/lib/img/posts/2024-05-01-BlackCat/writefile1.png)

Here it writes the bytes indicating the end of the file/JSON block.

## Config Extractor

Here's a simple config extractor I wrote for this sample :

```python
import os
import pefile

def config_extract(filename):
    pe = pefile.PE(filename)

    for section in pe.sections:
      if ".rdata" in section.Name.decode():
        config_start_offset = section.get_data().decode('latin-1').find("{\"config_id")
        if config_start_offset == -1 :
           return config_start_offset
        config_end_offset = section.get_data().decode('latin-1').find("]}",config_start_offset, )
        data = section.get_data().decode('latin-1')[config_start_offset:config_end_offset+2]
    return data

def main():
    files = os.listdir()
    for file in files:
            with open(file, "rb") as f:
                magic_number = f.read(2)
                if magic_number == b"MZ":
                    filename = file
                    data = config_extract(filename)
                    if data == -1 :
                        print("couldn't find config, maybe it's located elsewhere or encrypted. please make sure you have the right file.\n")
                    else :
                        print(f"File {filename} -- CONFIG : \n")
                        print(data)
                        print(f"\n================= \n")
                
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Removal Tool

Sadly, since the affiliates would have the private RSA key, I won't be able to construct a file decryption script.

Yet, here's a simple removal tool I wrote based on my YARA rule :

```python
import yara
import os

rules = yara.compile(filepaths={
  'blackcat_rule':"rules\\BlackCat_rule.yar"
})

def removal_routine(data=None):
    if data != None :
        print(f"[MATCHED] File :: {file.name} ---- Attempting DELETION\n")
        try :
            file.close()
            os.remove(file.name)
        except() as error:
            print(f"error on deleting {file.name} :: {error} \n")
            pass
        print(f"[DELETED] File :: {file.name} \n")
    return yara.CALLBACK_CONTINUE

directory ='DIR_Name'
for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    f = os.path.join(directory, filename)
    # checking if it is a file
    if os.path.isfile(f):
        with open(f, 'rb') as file:
            matches = rules.match(data=file.read(), callback=removal_routine, which_callbacks=yara.CALLBACK_MATCHES)

```
